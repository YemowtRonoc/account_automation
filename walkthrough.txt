Prerequisites:    
    
    SSH Keys:
    To use this program, you need to set up SSH keys with the repo server.
    To do this, go to a terminal, and enter: ssh-keygen
    This will generate an authentication key for your ssh instance.
    From there, copy the key to the repo server.
    "ssh-copy-id fs@127.0.0.1", with fs as a placeholder for the repo username, 
    and 127.0.0.1 as a placeholder for the repo server IP.
    
    Resetting Constants:
    In the constants.py file at the root directory of the project, there are
    some constants that you may want to update. Mainly the BUGZILLA_URL and 
    DEFAULT_PASSWORD. This is if you want to change either the url to get to 
    bugzilla, or the default password given to the new hires accounts.
    
    Setup Scripts:
    The setup scripts will do most of the setup required before running the
    automation. This installs most the dependencies and updates what is needed.
    Each step is: 
    - installs expect
    - updates firefox
    - install pip
    - selenium for python
    - geckodriver for selenium interaction with firefox
    - gmail python api client.
    
    Gmail Authentication:
    To setup gmail authentication, follow the steps in the following link
    (Note: The quickstart file can be found in the email_notification subfolder. Ensure it's 
    run while your working directory is the root of the account_automation project.) 
    https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python 
    The client_secret.json should be placed in the root of the project.


Running the account_automation:

    To run account_automation, simply go to the parent directory and enter 
    "python account_automation" in the terminal. This should give you a list of prompts for
    the necessary details to automate the account creation. 
    The details requested are: 
    - the name of the new hire (-n, --name)
    - the email of the new hire (-e, --email)
    - whether or not the new hire is a developer (-d, --dev)
    - the bugzilla login of the admin   (-a --adminemail)
    - the bugzilla password of the admin
    - the IP address of the repo server (127.0.0.1) (-r, --reposerver)
    - the admin username on the repo server (root) (-u, --adminusername)
    - the password for the admin of the repo server
